# Phasing - Concepts

Phasing is a new programming concept that is aimed to help reduce the amount of code needed to be written, by having everything be ran in phases in one line

## Information
- `@0` - The result of the first parameter, this will go on and on
- `@<` - The result of the previous parameter
