[Docs](docs/docs.md) | [TODO](TODO.md)

> Project no longer in development

> **NOTE:** Drast is still in its development phase, so expect some bugs and missing features.

## Features

- **Super Simple and Easy to learn syntax** - Similar to Python's humanly syntax whilst being as fast as C
- **Semi-Object Oriented** - No need to learn all the OOP concepts
- More to come...

## Example

All examples are located in [`examples`](https://github.com/Malvion/drast/tree/master/examples)

## Building

Drast is built similarly for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Before you start building Drast, you must install these dependencies listed below:

- Windows: Install CMake and Visual Studio
- macOS: `brew install cmake`
- Linux: `sudo apt install git cmake`

Run the following command after the required dependencies are installed:

```batch
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Malvion/drast
cd drast
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

If all goes well, Drast should be built and ready to run! If you have encountered any errors, please report them in
the 'Issues' tab!

> **NOTE:** For Windows, in the build directory, there should be a Visual Studio solution file. Double click this file,
> then build and
> run.
