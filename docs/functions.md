# Functions

## Declaring functions

Functions are declared with the fn keyword, following a name, a list of arguments and optionally a type.

```
fn multiply(first: float, second: float) -> float:
    return first * second
```

## Calling functions

Function calls are similar as in most programming language

```
fn main(argc: int, argv: [string]):
    return multiply(50, 0)
```

It is a good exercise to use CamelCase when declaring enums normally. However, there are sometimes exceptions.
