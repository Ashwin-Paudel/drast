# Variables

## Declaring variables

Variables are declared with the name first, followed by an optional type and an expression.

Constants follow the same syntax however, there is `let` at the beginning.

```
// Variables
helloWorld := "Hello World"
helloWorld: string = "Hello World"

// Constants
let HELLO_WORLD := "Hello World"
let HELLO_WORLD: string = "Hello World" 
```
